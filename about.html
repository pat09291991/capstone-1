      <p class="card-text mb-0 text-white">Mt. Maculot is one of the most popular daytrip destinations. It is so popular that on weekends and summer months, there is a sari-sari store, dubbed ‘7-11’ at the campsite. This mountain, at the heart of Batangas, is known as a landmark for locals and travelers alike; it is easily identifiable because of its abruptly terminating east side – forming a cliff that is challenging for rock climbers and breathtaking to everybody else. Others describe the shape of the mountain as ‘igloo-like’.At 930 MASL, the mountain has three destinations: the famous Rockies (706m), the summit (930m) and the Grotto (510m). These can all be covered by a traverse dayhike, but most climbers head to the Rockies, which is the reason why Maculot is the paragon of an easy hike. Only 5% of hikers pursue the traverse, but we hope more people will explore the “forested side” of the mountain.</p>

				Nueva Ecija, long overlooked as an outdoor destination, is now in the hiking map thanks to the efforts of the Nueva Ecija Backpackers and Mountaineering Community (NEBMC) and the LGUs they’ve been closely working with. Even from a distance, majestic Mt. Kemalugong is clearly the king of the Nueva Ecija mountains, but there are also minor hikes that can serve as local favorites – and worthy trips for Metro Manila folks weary of the usual Rizal mountains.
